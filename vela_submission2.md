•	We have changed our concept completely. We went from creating a LinkedIn and Google Maps implementation, to trying to create a two-player battlefield game, to creating a Yelp API. We re-wrote abstracts and researched different implementations to get ourselves on the right track to developing something useful with transparency.
•	We have been able to implement a simple connection to the Yelp servers to obtain information. Mentioned previously, we were caught in the concept before we created anything
•	My individual contribution is as follows:
•	  Created old repository for previous ideas
•	  Conceptualize all ideas thus far
•	  Helped contribute to abstracts
•	  Worked with Jayson to create a practical guide to the API
•	We still need to implement a system that can return the highest rated restaurant, coffee shop, etc. in a given city specified by the user. Still need to add cheapest high rated food places. Need to add a search to find the cities with the highest and most frequent reviews. And other useful functions.
•	Plan on getting the points listed above completed, perhaps others we conceptualize can be added.
